    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The MSA Pairformer (2025.08.02.668173v1) introduces a 111M-parameter architecture that leverages multiple sequence alignments and a query-biased pair representation to achieve state-of-the-art performance in contact prediction, protein–protein interface identification, and variant effect prediction. Beyond benchmarks, the paper advances a mechanistic claim: that the model mitigates phylogenetic averaging by weighting sequences according to their evolutionary relevance to the query, thereby recovering subfamily-specific signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interpretation hinges on an assumption that has not been directly tested: that learned sequence weights align with phylogenetic similarity, not merely raw sequence identity. The authors provide indirect evidence—bimodal weight distributions within the response regulator family, improved recovery of subfamily-specific contacts, and weight–identity correlations—but these do not establish whether the model is actually sensitive to tree-based lineage structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we examine the relationship between learned sequence weights and phylogenetic distance. Our goal is not to challenge the reported performance, but to evaluate the evolutionary interpretation. By linking weights to tree-based measures of relatedness, we can clarify whether the Pairformer is genuinely capturing subfamily-specific phylogenetic signal, or whether its behavior is better explained by local sequence identity and compositional effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Re-examining the Response Regulator Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "The original paper highlights the response regulator (RR) family as a case study for subfamily-specific signal. There, query-biased weights displayed a bimodal distribution: sequences belonging to the same subfamily as the query were consistently upweighted, while sequences from other subfamilies were downweighted. This was presented as evidence that the model captures lineage structure, rather than relying solely on raw sequence identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate this claim more directly, we begin by reproducing the RR multiple sequence alignment (MSA) used in the paper. This alignment serves as the foundation for both the subfamily analysis and our subsequent phylogenetic analysis. By rebuilding the MSA in a transparent, reproducible way, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirm that the alignment and sequence set are comparable to those used in the published case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide input to the MSA Pairformer, enabling us to extract query-biased weights via a forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Establish a consistent dataset on which to perform downstream analyses, including the correlation of weights with tree-based phylogenetic distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, we will generate the RR MSA. This involves identifying the same protein family and constructing the alignment under similar constraints (e.g., filtering thresholds, depth caps). The resulting MSA will then be used as input to the model, forming the basis of our re-analysis."
