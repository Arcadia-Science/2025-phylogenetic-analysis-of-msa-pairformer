	abstract = {Recent efforts in protein language modeling have focused on scaling single-sequence models and their training data, requiring vast compute resources that limit accessibility. Although models that use multiple sequence alignments (MSA), such as MSA Transformer, offer parameter-efficient alternatives by extracting evolutionary information directly from homologous sequences rather than storing it in parameters, they generally underperform compared to single-sequence-based language due to memory inefficiencies that limit the number of sequences and averaging evolutionary signals across the MSA. We address these challenges with MSA Pairformer, a 111M parameter memory-efficient MSA-based protein language model that extracts evolutionary signals most relevant to a query sequence through bi-directional updates of sequence and pairwise representations. MSA Pairformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised contact prediction, outperforming ESM2-15B by 6\% points while using two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. In predicting contacts at protein-protein interfaces, MSA Pair-former substantially outperforms all methods with a 24\% point increase over MSA Transformer. Unlike single-sequence models that deteriorate in variant effect prediction as they scale, MSA Pairformer maintains strong performance in both tasks. Ablation studies reveal triangle operations remove indirect correlations, and unlike MSA Transformer, MSA Pairformer does not hallucinate contacts after removing covariance, enabling reliable screening of interacting sequence pairs. Overall, our work presents an alternative to the current scaling paradigm in protein language modeling, enabling efficient adaptation to rapidly expanding sequence databases and opening new directions for biological discovery.},

	abstract = {Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of proteins encode rich biological information and have been workhorses in bioinformatic methods for tasks like protein design and protein structure prediction for decades. Recent breakthroughs like AlphaFold2 that use transformers to attend directly over large quantities of raw MSAs have reaffirmed their importance. Generation of MSAs is highly computationally intensive, however, and no datasets comparable to those used to train AlphaFold2 have been made available to the research community, hindering progress in machine learning for proteins. To remedy this problem, we introduce OpenProteinSet, an open-source corpus of more than 16 million MSAs, associated structural homologs from the Protein Data Bank, and AlphaFold2 protein structure predictions. We have previously demonstrated the utility of OpenProteinSet by successfully retraining AlphaFold2 on it. We expect OpenProteinSet to be broadly useful as training and validation data for 1) diverse tasks focused on protein structure, function, and design and 2) large-scale multimodal machine learning research.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are believed to contain a wealth of information on diversification processes. However, comparing phylogenetic trees is not straightforward due to their high dimensionality. Researchers have therefore defined a wide range of low-dimensional summary statistics. Currently, it remains unexplored to what extent these summary statistics cover the same underlying information and what summary statistics best explain observed variation across phylogenies. Furthermore, a large subset of available summary statistics focusses on measuring the topological features of a phylogenetic tree, but are often only explored at the extreme edge cases of the fully balanced or imbalanced tree and not for trees of intermediate balance. Here, we introduce a new R package called ‘treestats’, that provides speed optimized code to compute 70 summary statistics. We study correlations between summary statistics on empirical trees and on trees simulated using several diversification models. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm to create intermediately balanced trees in a well-defined manner, in order to explore variation in summary statistics across a balance gradient. We find that almost all summary statistics are correlated with tree size, and find that it is difficult, if not impossible, to correct for tree size, unless the tree generating model is known. Furthermore, we find that across empirical and simulated trees, at least three large clusters of correlated summary statistics can be found, where statistics group together based on information used (topology or branching times). However, the finer grained correlation structure appears to depend strongly on either the taxonomic group studied (in empirical studies) or the tree generating model (in simulation studies). Amongst statistics describing the (im)balance of a tree, we find that almost all statistics vary non-linearly, and sometimes even non-monotonically, with our generated balance gradient. This indicates that balance is perhaps a more complex property of a tree than previously thought. Furthermore, using our new imbalancing algorithm, we devise a numerical test to identify balance statistics, and identify several statistics as balance statistics that were not previously considered as such. Lastly, our results lead to several recommendations on which statistics to select when analyzing and comparing phylogenetic trees.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are central to many areas of biology, ranging from population genetics and epidemiology to microbiology, ecology, and macroevolution. The ability to summarize properties of trees, compare different trees, and identify distinct modes of division within trees is essential to all these research areas. But despite wide-ranging applications, there currently exists no common, comprehensive framework for such analyses. Here we present a graph-theoretical approach that provides such a framework. We show how to construct the spectral density profile of a phylogenetic tree from its Laplacian graph. Using ultrametric simulated trees as well as non-ultrametric empirical trees, we demonstrate that the spectral density successfully identifies various properties of the trees and clusters them into meaningful groups. Finally, we illustrate how the eigengap can identify modes of division within a given tree. As phylogenetic data continue to accumulate and to be integrated into various areas of the life sciences, we expect that this spectral graph-theoretical framework to phylogenetics will have powerful and long-lasting applications.},
